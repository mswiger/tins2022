# TINS 2022 - Acquire Currency

Swim around the level and collect all of the treasure, avoiding the deadly piranhas while doing so.
If you get too close to a piranha, it will chase you until you can create some distance.
Once all of the treasure has been collected, the portal will open so you may depart.
